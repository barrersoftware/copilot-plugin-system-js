# MCP Integration Research

**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Status:** Research only - NOT implementing yet

## What We Discovered

GitHub Copilot CLI has **native extensibility** via MCP (Model Context Protocol):

### MCP Features in Copilot CLI
- Custom MCP servers can be added via `--additional-mcp-config`
- Configuration can be inline JSON or from file
- Multiple MCP servers supported
- GitHub MCP server ships by default

### Command Examples
```bash
# Add MCP server inline
copilot --additional-mcp-config '{"mcpServers": {"my-tool": {...}}}'

# Add MCP server from file
copilot --additional-mcp-config @/path/to/config.json

# Chain multiple configs
copilot --additional-mcp-config @base.json --additional-mcp-config @overrides.json
```

## Current Approach (Keep This)

**Our SDK wrapper (@barrersoftware/copilot-plugins):**
- ✅ Programmatic plugin system for SDK users
- ✅ Slash command support
- ✅ Dynamic plugin loading
- ✅ Already published and working
- ✅ Respects pre-release license (no code modifications)

## Future Native Integration (If GitHub Wants It)

**Two possible paths:**

### Path 1: SDK Plugin System (Current)
- Keep as-is: wrapper around SDK
- Users: Developers building apps with the SDK
- Integration: Programmatic, JavaScript/TypeScript

### Path 2: MCP Server Plugins (Native CLI)
- Build plugins as MCP servers
- Users: CLI users who want to extend Copilot CLI
- Integration: Native, any language (MCP is language-agnostic)

### Path 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)
- SDK wrapper for programmatic use
- MCP server option for CLI use
- Same plugin logic, two interfaces

## Next Steps (When Ready)

**IF GitHub expresses interest in native integration:**

1. **Study MCP Protocol**
   - Read: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
   - Understand: Server architecture, tool definitions, lifecycle

2. **Build MCP-Compatible Plugins**
   - Convert our plugin system to MCP server format
   - Test with `--additional-mcp-config`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with SDK wrapper

3. **Propose to GitHub**
   - Show both approaches working
   - Let them choose integration path
   - Offer to relicense for official inclusion

## Why NOT Build This Yet

- ✅ **Wrapper works** - Don't over-engineer
- ✅ **License respect** - Study only, no modifications
- ✅ **Wait for demand** - Ship MVP first, iterate based on feedback
- ✅ **Their decision** - Let GitHub guide integration approach

## References

- **Copilot CLI npm package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot?activeTab=readme
- **Copilot SDK (dependency)**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot-sdk
- Copilot CLI Changelog: MCP server entries
- GitHub Copilot CLI repo: https://github.com/github/copilot-cli (installer/docs only, not source)
- License: GitHub Pre-release License (viewable but not modifiable)
- Our package: @barrersoftware/copilot-plugins (npm)

## Important Discovery

**The CLI relies on the SDK as a dependency!** This means:

- ✅ **We already know the SDK** - That's what our plugin system wraps
- ✅ **No need to study CLI internals** - The SDK is the core interface
- ✅ **Our wrapper is SDK-native** - We're already at the right abstraction level
- ✅ **CLI repo has no source** - Just installer and docs (binary distribution)

**Implication:** Our SDK-based plugin system is already positioned perfectly. The CLI uses the same SDK we're wrapping, so our plugins work at the foundational level.

---

**Bottom Line:** We're ready for native integration IF GitHub wants it, but our current wrapper is solid and respects all licenses. Research complete, implementation on hold pending demand.
